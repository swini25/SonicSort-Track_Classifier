"Project SonicSort: Revolutionizing Music Classification in the Streaming Era"

In response to the explosive growth of the streaming music industry, where users and services grapple with the manual management of vast music libraries, Project SonicSort aims to redefine the music experience. Serving as the backbone for features like personalized recommendations and soundtrack recognition in streaming applications, music genre classification becomes pivotal. By automating the tagging of unknown tracks using robust machine learning models, we aspire to streamline user interactions and elevate overall satisfaction.

Our project focuses on building cutting-edge models that classify audio clips into eight distinct music genres. Leveraging three different deep learning approaches alongside regression models, we delve into the intricate relationship between frequency and time domain features. Extracting insights from MFCC and Mel spectrogram features, our exploration not only enhances the music classification process but also provides a unique opportunity to compare the efficacy of deep learning models with classical machine learning algorithms.

Join us on this musical journey, where data meets melody, and technology harmonizes with user preferences.
